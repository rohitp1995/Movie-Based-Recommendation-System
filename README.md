# Movie-Based-Recommendation-System

## Definition
Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.

## Approach Used

**Content-Based Filtering**

A filtration strategy for movie recommendation systems, which uses the data provided about the items (movies). This data plays a crucial role here and is extracted from only one user. An ML algorithm used for this strategy recommends motion pictures that are similar to the userâ€™s preferences in the past. Therefore, the similarity in content-based filtering is generated by the data about the past film selections and likes by only one user.

How does it work? The recommendation system analyzes the past preferences of the user concerned, and then it uses this information to try to find similar movies. This information is available in the database (e.g., lead actors, director, genre, etc.). After that, the system provides movie recommendations for the user. That said, the core element in content-based filtering is only the data of only one user that is used to make predictions.
